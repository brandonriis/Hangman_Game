# Hangman_Game
This is a basic Hangman game. It will select a word and then give the user 10 tries at guessing the letters.

It will pull a word at random form the word.txt file and then allow the user to guess the letters
one by one. Filling the blank spaces with the letter if it is correct and tell the user if it is not.
Each user input has been validated with the option to play again triggered by a win or the player running
out of tries.
